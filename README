This gem'll work hand-in-hand with GitHub's API to help you out.

Catch us in the #github room on freenode if you want to get involved.  Or just fork and send a pull request.

Getting started
===========
If you want, you can use `gemify' to make a gem to install. 

Otherwise, you can use a bash alias to run the script from anywhere!
  $ alias github="/path/to/github-gem/bin/github"

Then you can run it:
  $ github <command> <args>
