The GitHub Gem
=============

This gem'll work hand-in-hand with GitHub's API to help you out.

Catch us in the #github room on freenode if you want to get involved.  Or just fork and send a pull request.

===========
Getting started
===========

  $ gem install github

Run it:

  $ github <command> <args>


=============
Pulling Changes
=============

Let's say you just forked `github-gem` on GitHub from defunkt.

  $ git clone git://github.com/YOU/github-gem.git
  $ cd github-gem
  $ github pull defunkt

This will setup a remote and branch for defunkt's repository at master. 
In this case, a 'defunkt/master' branch.

If defunkt makes some changes you want, simply `github pull defunkt` then 
`git merge defunkt/master`
